# Silver & Gold

### Introduction

Silver & Gold is a game in which you try getting rich during the 1852 California Gold Rush.
As you claw and dig, you will be able to buy and sell resources, while upgrading your tools.
Over the span of 31 days, you must hit it big or go home in debt.

*yeah that's cool lucas but how does it work*

Shut up. With the power of magic, `import random`, and too many if/else statements, you get the authentic experience.

They'll be more here, after there's actually some code going on. Wish me luck!
